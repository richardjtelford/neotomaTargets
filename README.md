# neotomaTargets

`neotomaTargets` is a template for reproducible research using data from
the [Neotoma database](https://www.neotomadb.org/) using the

It includes sample code for downloading data from Neotoma, cleaning the
data, analysing the data, and writing a manuscript with R markdown, all
in a `targets` pipeline.
